Description: client for the eD2k and Kad networks, like eMule
 aMule is a peer-to-peer file sharing application, designed to connect
 to the eDonkey and Kad networks. It has a wide range of features,
 including many of the original eMule client, like:
 .
  * online signature, source exchange, compressed transfers, secure
    identification, and IP filter support
  * boolean search, which can be local, global, or in the Kad network
  * checks against aggressive clients
  * slot allocation, to decide the number of remote clients
  * systray works well both in GNOME and KDE
  * translations to many languages
 .
 A daemonized version of the application that does not need a graphic
 environment to run is available in the amule-daemon package, and
 various utilities of interest can be found in the amule-utils and
 amule-utils-gui packages, including the ed2k link handler.

  * cas: displays the contents of your aMule online signature
  * alcc: computes ed2k:// links for the given input files
  * amulecmd: text-based client to control aMule or the aMule daemon
 .
 Some of these utilities have graphic versions, which can be found in
 the amule-utils-gui package.

Description: non-graphic version of aMule, a client for the eD2k and Kad networks
 This package contains a daemonized version of aMule, amuled, that does
 not need a graphic environment to run, and can run in the background as
 well. It is normally used to be run in a machine 24/7, since the
 application continues to run if the X11 session closes.
 .
 Included in the package is a webserver that provides an interface to
 control the daemon. Remote connections are supported, and the daemon
 can be configured to start the webserver automatically at startup. It
 is also possible to control amuled via amulecmd, from the amule-utils
 package, and amulegui, available in the amule-utils-gui package.
 .
 See the description of the amule package for a list of features, and
 /usr/share/doc/amule-daemon/README.Debian for some basic usage notes.

Description: ed2k links handling support for GNOME web browsers

 Flock, Seamonkey or Galeon.
